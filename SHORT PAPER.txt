Week 14
Topic: Back-End Programming: Ruby on Rails 


My background: I learned Python before and I know nothing about Ruby. After trying TryRuby (https://try.ruby-lang.org/), I personally think that Ruby is kind of similar to Python. For example,“ .gsub ” in Ruby is similar to “ .replace ” in Python. In Python, we use set {} and dictionary {} to define strings/numbers.  I also learned the same thing in TryRuby. As for Ruby on Rails, Rails is the framework and Ruby is the language. This is like the relationship between Python and Django. I want to explore the difference between Python and Ruby, so I browsed the Ruby on Rails community (https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/search?q=python). People seem to think that Ruby's language is more flexible and Python's language is more direct.


In MI-349 class we used JavaScript in html. I am curious if I can put Ruby into html. The answer is yes. We use “ <script src="name.js"></script> ” to import javascript in html. The method of using Ruby is different from javascript, Ruby is usually used to run code on the server instead of the browser. I can use Embedded Ruby to put Ruby in Html by using “ <% ” and “ %> ”. The file format is “ index.html.erb ”.
For example: 
Ruby code:


5.times do
  print 'Welcome '
end


Embedded Ruby in Html:


<ul>
  <% 5.times do %>


    <li>Welcome</li>


  <% end %>
</ul>
